## 🔍 Project Highlights (Executive Summary)

### 🎯 Objective
[cite_start]To apply Data Science techniques (Cleaning, EDA, Clustering, Machine Learning) to find correlations between **Bangkok's weather** and **Spotify Thailand's Top Charts** throughout 2023 [cite: 18-24].

### 💡 Key Insights from the Report
* **The "Rain Effect":** While general weather doesn't drastically change music taste, we found a specific anomaly during **"Heavy Rain" (>64.5mm)**. [cite_start]Songs with titles related to rain (e.g., "ฝนตกไหม") significantly spiked in rankings[cite: 665, 837].
* [cite_start]**Prediction Model:** We developed a Machine Learning model (Random Forest) that could predict temperature based on song attributes with reasonable accuracy, though rainfall prediction remains challenging due to external factors[cite: 807, 847].

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills Demonstrated
* [cite_start]**Data Preparation:** Merging datasets from Spotify API and Hydro-Informatics Institute (HII)[cite: 53, 56].
* [cite_start]**Clustering:** Used **K-Means (Elbow Method)** to categorize weather conditions[cite: 688].
* **Visualization:** Created Heatmaps and Scatter plots to identify trends.
* [cite_start]**Machine Learning:** Implemented `RandomForestRegressor` and `MultiOutputRegressor`[cite: 807].
